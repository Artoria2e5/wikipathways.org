This is the official repository for the [WikiPathways website](www.wikipathways.org).

### Development
**Branches**

* Master - the production code; should match what is live
* Dev - active development of quick features and bug fixes
* SSL - temporary branch to work out changes required for SSL certification to take hold

Start new branches when you want to develop a feature or bug fix over a longer period of time; then merge with ```Dev```.
